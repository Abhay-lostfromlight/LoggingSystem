Build FileStore.java:

Implement the Datastore interface

Use Java object serialization

Write to a file (start with "test.log")

Handle exceptions gracefully

Include proper resource management

Key Learning: File I/O, serialization, and error handling

Phase 4: Utility Components (Build Fourth)
7. Create Deep Copy Utility
Build DeepCopyUtil.java:

Implement object cloning using serialization

Handle the cloning of log collections

Include proper exception handling

Key Learning: Object cloning, serialization streams, and thread safety concepts

Phase 5: Core Logging Engine (Build Fifth)
8. Implement the Logger Class
This is the most complex component - build it incrementally:

Step 8a: Basic Structure
Create singleton pattern implementation

Add basic data structures (Set for tracking, Queue for processing)

Implement thread-safe getInstance() method

Step 8b: Simple Log Addition
Create addLog() method with basic functionality

Add timestamp and thread information automatically

Use synchronized blocks for thread safety

Step 8c: Batch Processing
Implement appendLog() method

Move logs from tracking set to processing queue

Add deep copying for thread safety

Step 8d: Asynchronous Processing
Add ExecutorService with fixed thread pool

Implement async log writing

Handle queue management and cleanup

Key Learning: Singleton pattern, thread safety, asynchronous programming, and concurrent collections
